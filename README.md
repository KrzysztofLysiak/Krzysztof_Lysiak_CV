ChessBot
ChessBot is a C++ based chess-playing program that allows users to play against a computer opponent. This project showcases key programming concepts such as inheritance, virtual functions, and method overloading.

Features:
Play chess against a computer opponent.
Utilizes object-oriented programming with inheritance.
Implements virtual functions for flexible move generation.
Demonstrates method overloading for enhanced functionality.





Virtual Pharmacy
Virtual Pharmacy is a multi-threaded application built with Python, utilizing the Pandas and Tkinter libraries. It allows users to manage and interact with a virtual pharmacy database, including adding, removing, and purchasing medications.

Features:
Multi-threaded application for improved performance.
Utilizes Pandas for efficient data management.
Tkinter for a user-friendly graphical interface.


These two projects demonstrate my skills in software development and my ability to work with different programming languages and libraries. I'm proud of these projects as they showcase my proficiency in both C++ and Python, and I'm excited to discuss them further in the context of potential opportunities.
